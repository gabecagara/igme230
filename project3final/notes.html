              <h2>Goals and Audience</h2>
              <br>
              <p>The intended audience for my website will mostly for both full-time and co-op employers. They would access my website in various possible ways; a LinkedIn connection, networking, through links I provide through career fairs and other postings. They would access my website because of my active and ongoing search for those internship and full time career opportunities. Thus, I want my site to represent my breadth of skills and knowledge, and show the personable side of myself. </p>

                  <br>
              <h2>Design</h2>
              <br>
              <p>I want my website to be clear, concise and breathable. Thus, all elements have room to breathe, and I continued the use of white space. I used a pretty strict color palette that follows my logo which is in the top right hand corner to stick to my brand. </p>

              <h2>Interactive Changes</h2>
              <br>
          
                  <p>
                      There were several elemental changes I made to my portfolio site to make it more interactive. To start off, I integrated a page fade-in effect to several elements on the page on page loads. This can be found on several images and on the landing page. This interactive decision is to make it more airy and welcoming when a user loads a page. I got resources from my peers and on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11679567/using-css-for-fade-in-effect-on-page-load">stackoverflow</a>. I also included a more interactive navigation bar in terms of hover states, and also used hover states on image links. This can be seen especially in my projects page, in which I implemented hover states in which the image will hover up with a drop shadow and a parallax zoom in effect. This makes it more engaging and will influence the users to interact and click on the images. I received external help and feedback from my peer who is a web mobile design major and he provided resources from <a href="https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ">codepen</a> to help me achieve these effects.

              <h2>Above & Beyond</h2>
              <br>
              <p>I really wanted to experiment with the use of page load effects. Utilizing CSS and codepen really helped me along with what we learned in class using other outside Javascript clsses to help me achieve those effects. Because iamgery provides a lot of visual interest, having them have an effect on page load and cursor hovers was something I went above and beyond to do to make my page more interactice</p>
