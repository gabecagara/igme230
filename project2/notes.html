However, those external feedback and help I received significantly helped me understand the code, and I truly believe I learned so much about HTML/CSS in the past month from going through code in depth than I have ever before. 
 
 
 
Looking back, I am glad I did this project because though it was rather challenging, it was extremely rewarding. As a New Media Design student, I have been more accustomed to wireframing and sketching out ideas for web pages. This project helped me hone in my skills in aspects like responsive design, grid systems and learning to work with CSS frameworks. The hardest part of the project for me was the grid systems, because it was something I had not learned before. Thus, I took it upon myself to ask questions and go through several CSS frameworks that could give me the foundations to build pages in my site, particularly my Projects Page, which includes a 3 column grid. I have only gone through CSS frameworks twice in the past, so I had to ask a lot of questions and help during my free time to comb through the code, which was also challenging. However, those external feedback and help I received significantly helped me understand the code, and I truly believe I learned so much about HTML/CSS in the past month from going through code in depth than I have ever before. 
 
 
I used one CSS framework from this link, which featured a three column portfolio page grid, as well as a navigation bar which I utilized and turned into a hamburger menu. Even though I used that framework for the project page and navigation bar, I changed it significantly. Firstly, the CSS framework navigation bar was opposite from my design vision. If you took a look at the link, you may have noticed that the navigation bar was originally black, that the links were floating on the right and the logo was on the left. I changed it to fit my design documentation, which has a white navigation background, external links on the far left, and my personal logo on the far right. Furthermore, I had to change code to also change the fill of the hamburger menu
